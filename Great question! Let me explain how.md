Great question! Let me explain how the **Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol** works in this multi-agent travel planning system:

## 🔄 **A2A Protocol Flow in Travel Planning**

### **1. Travel Planner Agent (Orchestrator)**
The Travel Planner Agent acts as the **coordinator** and uses A2A protocol to communicate with specialized agents:

```python
# In travel_planner_agent_adk/travel_planner/agent.py
async def send_message(self, agent_name: str, task: str, tool_context: ToolContext):
    """Sends a task to a remote agent using A2A protocol."""
    if agent_name not in self.remote_agent_connections:
        raise ValueError(f"Agent {agent_name} not found")
    client = self.remote_agent_connections[agent_name]
    
    # Create A2A message format
    payload = {
        "message": {
            "role": "user",
            "parts": [{"type": "text", "text": task}],
            "messageId": message_id,
            "taskId": task_id,
            "contextId": context_id,
        },
    }
    
    message_request = SendMessageRequest(
        id=message_id, params=MessageSendParams.model_validate(payload)
    )
    send_response: SendMessageResponse = await client.send_message(message_request)
```

### **2. Specialized Agents (Hotel & Car Rental)**
These agents expose **A2A-compatible endpoints** that the Travel Planner can call:

```python
# In hotel_booking_agent_crewai/agent_executor.py
@app.post("/send_message")
async def send_message(request: SendMessageRequest) -> SendMessageResponse:
    """Handle incoming A2A messages."""
    # Extract user query from A2A message
    user_message = request.params.message
    user_text = ""
    
    if user_message.parts:
        for part in user_message.parts:
            if hasattr(part, 'text') and part.text:
                user_text += part.text
    
    # Process with hotel booking agent
    response_text = hotel_booking_agent.invoke(user_text)
    
    # Return A2A-compatible response
    artifact_part = TaskArtifactPart(type="text", text=response_text)
    artifact = TaskArtifact(type="text/plain", parts=[artifact_part])
    task = Task(artifacts=[artifact])
    
    return SendMessageResponse(
        id=request.id,
        root=SendMessageSuccessResponse(result=task)
    )
```

## 🎯 **Real-World Example Flow**

### **User Request**: "Plan a trip to Paris for next week"

1. **Travel Planner Agent** receives the request
2. **Travel Planner** uses A2A to ask **Hotel Booking Agent**:
   ```
   "Find hotels in Paris for check-in 2024-01-15 and check-out 2024-01-22"
   ```
3. **Travel Planner** uses A2A to ask **Car Rental Agent**:
   ```
   "Find car rentals in Paris from 2024-01-15 to 2024-01-22"
   ```
4. **Travel Planner** compiles responses and creates itinerary

## 🔧 **A2A Protocol Components**

### **Message Format**
```json
{
  "message": {
    "role": "user",
    "parts": [{"type": "text", "text": "Find hotels in Paris"}],
    "messageId": "uuid",
    "taskId": "uuid", 
    "contextId": "uuid"
  }
}
```

### **Response Format**
```json
{
  "id": "message_id",
  "root": {
    "result": {
      "artifacts": [{
        "type": "text/plain",
        "parts": [{"type": "text", "text": "Hotel search results..."}]
      }]
    }
  }
}
```

## 🌐 **Network Communication**

### **Agent Discovery**
```python
# Travel Planner discovers other agents
async def _async_init_components(self, remote_agent_addresses: List[str]):
    async with httpx.AsyncClient(timeout=30) as client:
        for address in remote_agent_addresses:
            card_resolver = A2ACardResolver(client, address)
            card = await card_resolver.get_agent_card()
            remote_connection = RemoteAgentConnections(
                agent_card=card, agent_url=address
            )
            self.remote_agent_connections[card.name] = remote_connection
```

### **Agent URLs**
- **Hotel Booking Agent**: `http://localhost:10002`
- **Car Rental Agent**: `http://localhost:10003`
- **Travel Planner Agent**: `http://localhost:10001` (ADK web interface)

## 🎭 **Benefits of A2A Protocol**

1. **Standardized Communication**: All agents use the same message format
2. **Loose Coupling**: Agents can be developed independently
3. **Scalability**: Easy to add new specialized agents
4. **Interoperability**: Different frameworks (ADK, CrewAI, LangGraph) can communicate
5. **Context Preservation**: Task and context IDs maintain conversation flow

## 🔄 **Complete A2A Workflow**

```
User → Travel Planner Agent (ADK)
         ↓ (A2A Protocol)
    Hotel Booking Agent (CrewAI)
         ↓ (A2A Response)
    Travel Planner Agent
         ↓ (A2A Protocol)  
    Car Rental Agent (LangGraph)
         ↓ (A2A Response)
    Travel Planner Agent
         ↓ (Final Response)
    User
```

The A2A protocol enables **seamless coordination** between agents built with different frameworks, making it possible to create sophisticated multi-agent systems where each agent specializes in its domain while maintaining standardized communication!




I see the issue! The `a2a-sdk` package isn't available in the standard PyPI repository. Let me help you fix this and provide the correct installation process.

## 🔧 **Fix for a2a-sdk Installation**

The `a2a-sdk` is Google's Agent-to-Agent SDK that needs to be installed from Google's repository. Let me update the installation process:

Now let me create a simplified version that doesn't require a2a-sdk for testing purposes:

Now let me create the actual test scripts:

## 🚀 **How to Invoke the Process**

Here's the complete step-by-step process to invoke and run your multi-agent travel planning system:

### **Option 1: Quick Test (Recommended First)**

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install groq langchain_groq crewai langgraph langchain-core fastapi uvicorn pydantic python-dotenv requests serper-python
   ```

2. **Create `.env` file** in `travel_planning_system/`:
   ```
   GROQ_API_KEY="your_groq_api_key_here"
   SERPER_API_KEY="your_serper_api_key_here"
   ```

3. **Test Individual Agents**:
   ```bash
   # Test Hotel Agent
   cd travel_planning_system/hotel_booking_agent_crewai
   python test_hotel_agent.py
   
   # Test Car Rental Agent
   cd ../car_rental_agent_langgraph
   python test_car_agent.py
   ```

### **Option 2: Full Multi-Agent System (With A2A Protocol)**

1. **Install a2a-sdk**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/google/a2a-python.git
   cd a2a-python
   pip install -e .
   cd ..
   ```

2. **Run All Agents** (in separate terminals):
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Car Rental Agent
   cd travel_planning_system/car_rental_agent_langgraph
   python app/__main__.py
   
   # Terminal 2: Hotel Booking Agent
   cd ../hotel_booking_agent_crewai
   python __main__.py
   
   # Terminal 3: Travel Planner Agent
   cd ../travel_planner_agent_adk
   adk web
   ```

3. **Access the System**:
   - **Web Interface**: http://localhost:10001
   - **Test Queries**: "Plan a trip to Paris for next week"

### **Expected Output**

When you run the test scripts, you should see:
- ✅ Agent initialization success
- 🔍 Search queries being processed
- 📊 Hotel/car rental results from SerperAPI
- 🤖 Responses generated by Groq Llama-3 70B

### **Troubleshooting**

- **If you get import errors**: Make sure all dependencies are installed
